# PrintPlus
This is a web application, and it revolves around  solution for community problem. In our university, we have a printing room - PrintPlus, where we students are in queue to get out our print outs. So, this is a long time - consuming process, and it has various problems associated to it. So, to solve these problems I'm here with this solution - PrintPlus web application.

Basically, this project is made for the users who face the problem of standing in queue for the 
printouts in ICT lab of Avantika university. The time of students wastes in standing in queue for hours.
On this website the user see the queue and the time to take out the printouts. So, he accordingly go to 
the ICT for prints. The user can also upload his/her files and can will the form for the requirements 
like orientation, color, paper size, etc. and can do the payment so the file directly will go ICT and on 
the next page the form summary and time in printouts will be available.
